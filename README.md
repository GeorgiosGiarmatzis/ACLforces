# ACLforces
This project aspires to estimate how motion strategy affects AC forces during a submaximal Hop Distance test.
A knee ligament model (Stanev et al) has been included in Hamner's model and simulation were run in Opensim, calculating kinematics, kinetics, muscle and ligament forces (ACLforces). Random Forest Regressor was employed to estimate the important predictors of ACl forces from all other estimated metrics (Statistics with Normalized Data).
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to generate synthetic data of the movement in question, hoping to extend our dataset into more dynamic movements and closer to a high-risk for ACL rupture movement.
